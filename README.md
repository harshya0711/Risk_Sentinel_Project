# RiskSentinel360: Operational Risk & Control Assessment Suite

## üöÄ Project Overview

**RiskSentinel360** is an end-to-end operational risk identification, assessment, control testing, and thematic reporting system designed to simulate the exact workflows expected in the Analyst, ICS Control Management role at American Express.

This project demonstrates deep understanding of:
- Risk and control mapping across business units and processes
- Process Self Risk Assessments (PRSAs) with inherent and residual risk scoring
- Control effectiveness evaluation through QA test results
- Thematic risk reporting with trends, root causes, and alerts

Built with a focus on real-world applicability, RiskSentinel360 leverages SQL for data management and Power BI/Tableau for interactive dashboards.

## üì¶ Project Components

### 1. SQL Database Schema & Dummy Data  
- Contains tables for Business Units, Processes, Risks, Controls, Control-Risk mappings, PRSA scores, and Control Test results.  
- Sample data simulates multiple BUs and operational scenarios.

### 2. SQL Queries  
- 20+ ready-to-run SQL queries demonstrating basic to advanced analysis: risk trends, control failures, root cause analysis, and risk scoring.

### 3. Dashboard Visualizations (Power BI / Tableau) *(to be built separately)*  
- Risk heatmaps, control failure trends, high-risk alerts, and thematic root cause reports.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Set up the SQL Database**  
   - Run `risk_sentinel.sql` in your MySQL/PostgreSQL environment to create the schema and insert dummy data.

2. **Run SQL Queries**  
   - Use `risk_sentinel_queries.sql` to explore insightful risk & control reports.

3. **Build/Use Dashboards**  
   - Import the dataset into Tableau or Power BI.  
   - Use provided dashboards (or create your own) to visualize risk heatmaps and control performance.
